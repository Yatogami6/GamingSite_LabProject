    <h1>GTA 6 platforms: PS5 and Xbox Series X/S confirmed</h1>
    <h2>So far, it has been confirmed that GTA 6 will be coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X/S when it arrives. The news came by way of an official press release from Take Two, which states that: "GTA 6 is coming to PlayStation 5 computer entertainment systems and Xbox Series X|S games and entertainment systems in 2025". There's currently no mention of a PC launch, which might suggest it will follow a similar route to some of the previous GTA games that released on consoles first, before arriving on PC at a later date. </h2>
