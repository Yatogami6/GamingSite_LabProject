    <h2> Fortnite OG: Drop Back into Battle Royale Chapter 1!</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p> 
    <em>POV: It's 2018. Welcome to Fortnite OG.</em>
    <br>
    <br>
    Drop in the original Island once again in Fortnite Battle Royale <strong> Chapter 4 Season OG.</strong>Throughout “Fortnite OG,” each major update will bring a different phase of Battle Royale’s past, starting with Chapter 1 Season 5. That means Shopping Carts, ATKs, the Assault Rifle, Pump Shotgun, and more in both Battle Royale and Zero Build!

    <h2> The Battle Is Building, Back In Time</h2>
    <p> 
        Go back in time Season by Season. Some of the unvaulted gear in each update will remain for that update, be in more than one update, or stay for the rest of Fortnite OG ⛏ Everything below is just part of what’ll be unvaulted:

    <h3>A POI introduced in Season 2, Tilted Towers stayed on the Island until Season 9.</h3>

    <p>Season 5, the Season where worlds collided… and players collided with All Terrain Karts! Take up weapons, Traps, and vehicles that were present in the original Season 5.</p>
